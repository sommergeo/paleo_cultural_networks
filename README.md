This repository contains reproducible data and code for the publication Sommer, C., Kandel, A. & Hochschild, V. (2022): "The use of perhistoric 'Big Data' for mapping early human cultural networks".

While this repository includes all input data and allows to reproduce all analytical steps, it does not contain the final results and intermediary datasets due to Github's file size restrictions. A complete dataset with input, code and outputs is permanently available on Zenodo under a CC BY 4.0 license:
